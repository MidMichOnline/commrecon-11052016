# Haunted Forest thrilled Community during weekend before Halloween

The Haunted Forest returned this year just in time for Halloween. The public was invited to tour the “Haunted Forest” on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. Consisting entirely of volunteers who decorate the woods and set up scare stations, this was the fifth year that the Haunted Forest has been in operation.

403 visitors passed through the Haunted Forest during its three day run. A portion of the proceeds from tickets sales were donated to the Isabella County branch of the Foster Closet of Michigan organization. Donations were also be accepted on behalf of the Foster Closet.

On Sunday, October 30, Holly Watson, branch manager for Foster Closet, visited the Haunted Forest group to accept a check and pick up the items which had been collected over the weekend.
