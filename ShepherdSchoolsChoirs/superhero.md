# Adventures of a Comic Book Artist

@[ShepherdSchoolsChoirs](https://www.facebook.com/shepherdchoirs/?fref=nf) This week the Middle School Choirs will participate in the performances of "The Adventures Of A Comic Book Artist" with the Middle School Drama Cast and Crew. If interested, evening performances are on Friday and Saturday at 7PM.
I would encourage everyone that loves theater, to come and check it out. The music is catchy, there are lots of jokes, and who doesn't like a story with loads of superheroes?!
All of the students have been working hard. The choir students sound good, and its only October! Please come and support the arts at Shepherd. Lots of new and exciting things are happening with the choirs, but you will have to see it to believe it!
